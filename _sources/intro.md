# Welcome to your Web development from scratch 

In this book we will create a book review project from scratch using python, html and css only.
    In the process you will learn fundamental principals of web development. 
Once we have a grasp of the basic principles of web development we will then  create the same project 
book review with a database say sqlite but the concept will work with any database. 

Later will implement the same project with a framework like Django to understand why we need a framework and also to understand django. 

After implementing in Django will then dive into single page apps where we will implement the project in React. 

We will then do the same project with Sprint Java, Sprint Kotlin, Kotlin and Golang just to understand other frameworks.

Assumption that you already know how to code with python
